- how can system follow such use case:
  - farming / borrowing on xlend.extrafi.io
    - supply cbBTC on Base
    - extra incentive through Merkl that gives
      - OP on Optimism
      - xOP on Optimism staked on xlend.extrafi.io
      - some EXTRA tokens on Optimism
    - occasionally claimed and swapped to WBTC (no cbBTC on Optimism)
    - then jumper that moves and trades it to cbBTC on Base
    - supply cbBTC to farm to decrease debt
