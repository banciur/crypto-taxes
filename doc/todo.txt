First stage: compute german taxes
TODO: snapshot mechanism to catch changes in time. Start with value.
TODO: first attempt of taxes computation.
TODO: kraken importer create fake accuisition events
TODO: Make tests more readable by automatically generating timestamps

TODO: Add original transaction place and id ex (Ethereum, tx hash) to the LedgerEvent
TODO: Import data from as this should be very easy:
  - Coinbase
  - Lido
  - Stakewise
TODO: On-chain events, what could be the source
TODO: how to combine different sources of transactions
TODO: Probably will have to introduce manual adjustments
TODO: Verify against my own spreadsheet

TODO; question how to calculate income in case when I'm partly leaving the farm.
  Initial idea (from old model review)
  - ctokens only when token is sold compute gain as difference of value when bought (FIFO used for computing buy price)
  - atokens compute tax / gain every time it rebases and when selling no tax

TODO: Kraken scripts maybe move them to a separate directory, some common code can be extracted?
TODO: Review Coindesk source it's the worst code ever also review OpenExchanger client

TODO: Export data in a format that can be used by Steuerberater

TODO: Is there a possibility to have a whitelist of commands for codex?

Second stage: tracking wealth
TODO: better visualiation use some library to nicely print stuff or maybe switch to web app
TODO: Features from WEALTH_MODEL.md
  - income
  - realized P/L
  - unrealized P/L (by asset?)

Codex commands
------------------
npm list -g @openai/codex
npm install -g @openai/codex@latest
https://github.com/openai/codex/releases

Some loose ideas
------------------

- Ability to compute / enter the current value of open positions.
- Store history / snapshots of the state to catch changes in time

- Can system handle such use case, handle in terms of following transactions but also to compute
  the current state and profit (two or more currencies?) from the position
  - farming / borrowing on xlend.extrafi.io
    - supply cbBTC on Base
    - extra incentive through Merkl that gives
      - OP on Optimism
      - xOP on Optimism staked on xlend.extrafi.io
      - some EXTRA tokens on Optimism
    - occasionally claimed and swapped to WBTC (no cbBTC on Optimism)
    - then jumper that moves and trades it to cbBTC on Base
    - supply cbBTC to farm to decrease debt
    - borrowing USDC in xlend.extrafi.io
    - putting it into farm 40acres USDC Vault through vaults.fyi
    - occasionally get some money from the farm and repay part of the debt to decrease debt
