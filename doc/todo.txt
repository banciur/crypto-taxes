TODO: Is there a possibility to have a whitelist of commands for codex?

TODO: Basing on Kraken events first attempts of features:
  - compute profits on disposals and sum by month (consider fees)
  - Unrealized P/L by asset
  - compute tax-free assets (one-year rule) and their value
  - compute taxes

TODO: Import data from:
  - Coinbase
  - Lido
  - Stakewise
TODO: Add original transaction place and id ex (Ethereum, tx hash) to the LedgerEvent
TODO: On-chain events, what could be the source

TODO: how to combine different sources of transactions

TODO: Kraken scripts maybe move them to a separate directory, some common code can be extracted?
TODO: Review coindesk source it's the worst code ever

TODO: Probably will have to introduce manual adjustments
TODO: Verify against my own spreadsheet

TODO; question how to calculate income in case when I'm partly leaving the farm.
  Initial idea (from old model review)
  - ctokens only when token is sold compute gain as difference of value when bought (FIFO used for computing buy price)
  - atokens compute tax / gain every time it rebases and when selling no tax


Codex commands
------------------
npm list -g @openai/codex
npm install -g @openai/codex@latest
https://github.com/openai/codex/releases

Some loose ideas
------------------

- Ability to compute / enter the current value of open positions.
- Store history / snapshots of the state to catch changes in time
- Think about visualization of the current state?

- Can system handle such use case, handle in terms of following transactions but also to compute
  the current state and profit (two or more currencies?) from the position
  - farming / borrowing on xlend.extrafi.io
    - supply cbBTC on Base
    - extra incentive through Merkl that gives
      - OP on Optimism
      - xOP on Optimism staked on xlend.extrafi.io
      - some EXTRA tokens on Optimism
    - occasionally claimed and swapped to WBTC (no cbBTC on Optimism)
    - then jumper that moves and trades it to cbBTC on Base
    - supply cbBTC to farm to decrease debt
    - borrowing USDC in xlend.extrafi.io
    - putting it into farm 40acres USDC Vault through vaults.fyi
    - occasionally get some money from the farm and repay part of the debt to decrease debt
