First stage: compute German taxes

TODO: introduce events transformations layer, where raw data will be adjusted.
 - mark spam events (can be automatic?)
 - seed events used to balance ledger (already implemnted)

TODO: Add to my ~/.codex/AGENTS.md instruction to after making changes try to read general context and see if there could be some code refactoring done to reduce tech debt like code duplication or similar.

TODO: Fix codex not being able to run pnpm commands
TODO: Render transformations layer events in the UI as second column
TODO: Maybe third "outcome" column in the UI

TODO: On-chain events, Moralis
 - not finished with a break for the UI.
 - client is morels ready but importer just some vibed crap
 - review client and accounts structure, also think about wallet id (address_chain)
 - do we need native tokens?

TODO: Improve how events are displayed in the UI. Add chains transaction ids, tokens names etc
TODO: Manual adjustments to mark and filter out spam transactions.

TODO: additional correction elements
 - mark non-taxable events (income)
 - combine two (or more?) events into one

TODO: Import data from Coinbase hopefully through API

TODO: still need it? Maybe good UI is enough? tool to print from db event, legs etc for debugging. After provided id print whole network of entities
TODO: I'm suspicious of the tax calculations. Think how we can debug it better.

TODO: Need manual exception on taxes for some transactions. Example when Neufund gave me BTC/ETH as a bonus.
TODO: Restore inventory taxable and free.
TODO: Maybe time to change implementation and add connections to objects, not just id's. Or maybe create object repos so we could query them easily. Or just good old SQLAlchemy?
TODO: Do we need extra snapshot mechanism to, for example, output value of wallets?
TODO: Review inventory again. I don't like those intermediate objects also ones in taxes.

TODO: Import data from as this should be very easy:
  - Lido
  - Stakewise
TODO: Verify against my own spreadsheet

TODO: How to calculate income and taxes in case when I'm partly leaving the farm.
 Initial idea (from old model review)
 - ctokens only when token is sold compute gain as difference of value when bought (FIFO used for computing buy price)
 - atokens compute tax / gain every time it rebases and when selling no tax

TODO: Kraken scripts maybe move them to a separate directory, some common code can be extracted?
TODO: Review Coindesk source it's the worst code ever also review OpenExchanger client
TODO: DB improvements.
 - use Enums
 - use UUID type

TODO: Export data in a format that can be used by Steuerberater

TODO: Date chooser could be improved (in far futuren when I will need to make it nice)
 - it could follow (open/close) when the main section is being scrolled
 - active state of year and month should be properly stated

TODO: Is there a possibility to have a whitelist of commands for codex?

Second stage: tracking wealth
TODO: better visualiation use some library to nicely print stuff or maybe switch to web app
TODO: Features from WEALTH_MODEL.md
 - income
 - realized P/L
 - unrealized P/L (by asset?)

Codex commands
------------------
npm list -g @openai/codex
npm install -g @openai/codex@latest
https://github.com/openai/codex/releases

Libraries docs
------------------
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3
https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app
https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/overview
https://react.dev/reference/react

Some loose ideas
------------------
- Ability to compute / enter the current value of open positions.
- Store history / snapshots of the state to catch changes in time

- Can system handle such use case, handle in terms of following transactions but also to compute
  the current state and profit (two or more currencies?) from the position
  - farming / borrowing on xlend.extrafi.io
    - supply cbBTC on Base
    - extra incentive through Merkl that gives
      - OP on Optimism
      - xOP on Optimism staked on xlend.extrafi.io
      - some EXTRA tokens on Optimism
    - occasionally claimed and swapped to WBTC (no cbBTC on Optimism)
    - then jumper that moves and trades it to cbBTC on Base
    - supply cbBTC to farm to decrease debt
    - borrowing USDC in xlend.extrafi.io
    - putting it into farm 40acres USDC Vault through vaults.fyi
    - occasionally get some money from the farm and repay part of the debt to decrease debt


- Polish bonds income
